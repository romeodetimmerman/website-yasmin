In that same year, I started working at Vrije Universiteit Brussel as a research and teaching assistant. In 2021, I was granted a FWO fellowship for fundamental research to work on my PhD project for which I analyze language attitudes and ideologies qualitatively, and language use quantitatively with inferential statistics."
