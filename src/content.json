      "I obtained my master's degree in English and Dutch linguistics and literature from Ghent University in 2020. Since then, I have worked as a researcher on a one-year FWO-funded research project, and as a full-time language instructor. In November 2022, I started working as a doctoral researcher at Ghent University under supervision of Prof. Dr. Stef Slembrouck (UGent) and Prof. Dr. Matthias Heyman (VUB). My PhD project focuses on the use of African American English by contemporary blues performers, and the social meanings that these stylistic-linguistic practices generate."
